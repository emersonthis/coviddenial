# COVIDDENIAL.ORG

Thanks for your interest in this project. The goal is to raise awareness and provide clear, concise answers to common misconceptions about the pandemic.

## How you can help

### Submit content

Are lots of people around you saying something that is inaccurate or uninformed? We'll add it here.

### Improve the site

This was built in a hurry, so the styles a layout are very basic. PRs are welcome!

### Promote the site

Do you hear someone saying one of the falsehoods on this site? Share the URL.


## Local development

I've kept it very simple. This site is almost entirely static HTML and vanilla CSS with a tiny bit of PHP sprinkled in to make it easier to manage the content separately from the design. Clone this repository, and then run `php -S 0.0.0.0:3000`. You should be able to view your local copy of the site at `0.0.0.0:3000`. You can adjust this IP address (or port) if necessary.
